# mod.works SDK
Welcome to [mod.works](https://mod.works) SDK, built using C++. It allows game developers to host and automatically install user-created mods in their games. It connects to the [mod.works API](https://docs.mod.works), and [documentation for its endpoints](https://sdk.mod.works) can be viewed here.

## Getting started

If you are a game developer and want to add mod.works SDK functionality to your project visit our [getting started guide](https://github.com/DBolical/modworksSDK/wiki).

## Contributions Welcome
Our SDK is public and open source. Game developers are welcome to utilize it directly, to add support for mods in their games, or fork it to create plugins and wrappers for other engines and codebases. Many of these [contributions are shared](https://apps.mod.works) here. Want to make changes to our SDK? Submit a pull request with your recommended changes to be reviewed.
